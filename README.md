# blair-engineering-web

This is the repo for the Blair Engineering Club website. Currently we do not have a spot on binx, but we can still start work on it. 

This github repo is the TEST repo for the project. We will later be able to clone it to the Production repo that will be set up on binx.

## Basic Setup ##
You can ignore this if you already have an editor & git set up.

	1. Create a folder for the project.
	2. Install atom text editor.
	3. pull github repo onto folder using atom (look up tutorial online).

## Technologies ##
This is a rough plan, and might change.
